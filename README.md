This project is a small weather forecast app. It prompts the user to enter the name of a city, then presents a current weather check on that city, as well as a 5-day forecast. It also saves user inputs as a history to localstorage, so they can check on cities they've previously inputted.

This code works by creating an function based on a user-inputted form that will generate most of the HTML page through DOMs, accessing localstorage to create a history of previously inputted cities with a side function, and then request a url to fetch data from the weather API. It fetches from two weather APIs, first the "current weather data" API, and then the "one call API" noted in the instructions. It does this because the "one call API" cannot be used to search by city, so instead, the code uses "current weather data" to find the city the user wanted, then uses that city's latitude and longitutde to call the "one call API" correctly. It then proceeds to generate the rest of the page based on information returned from the fetch of the "one call API."
